# HubitatWizLightDriverX v1.01x
Hubitat Elevation device handler for Philips Wiz wi-fi color lights

## What can I do with this driver?
This driver lets the Hubitat control Wiz color bulbs.  It will probably
mostly work with Wiz on/off and variable CT white bulbs as well, but I only own
the color bulbs at this point and I haven't tested the others yet.

## EXPERIMENTAL VERSION NOTES
This version includes an experimental method for allowing Wiz effects settings
to be used from Hubitat groups and scenes.

#### Caution: Experimental!
I highly recommend that you use the normal version of this device handler unless
you have a specific need for features in the experimental version. 

## To Install and Use the Driver
Install and provision your Wiz bulb using the phone app.  Note the bulb's IP and MAC 
addresses.

On your Hubitat Elevation's admin page, select "Drivers Code", then click the
"New Driver" button.  Paste the Groovy driver code from this repository into 
the editor window and click the "SAVE" button.

Create a new virtual device on your Hubitat, name and label it, and select 
"Wiz Color Light Experimental" as the device type.  Save your new device.

Click the new device on the Hubitat's "Devices" page, and enter your light's
IP address in the provided field.
